Hello there 👋

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science, Electrical and Space Engineering](https://www.ltu.se/en/about-the-university/organisation/department-of-computer-science-electrical-and-space-engineering) at [Luleå University of Technology](https://www.ltu.se/en), Sweden. As a member of the [Robotics and Artificial Intelligence research group](https://www.fieldrobotics.eu/) within the Signal and System Division, I am guided by Professor [George Nikolakopoulos](https://www.gnikolak.com/).

I hold an Integrated Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Patras, Greece, where I specialized in automatic control and robotic systems.

My research focuses on edge computing architectures for robotic applications, aerial manipulation, and autonomy components.

🦾 I’m currently working on **Edge Robotics**.

🖥️ I’m mainly working with **ROS 1 / ROS 2** - **Python** - **C++** - **Docker** - **Kubernetes**.
