Hello there 👋

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science, Electrical and Space Engineering](https://www.ltu.se/en/about-the-university/organisation/department-of-computer-science-electrical-and-space-engineering) at [Luleå University of Technology](https://www.ltu.se/en), Sweden. As a member of the [Robotics and Artificial Intelligence research group](https://www.fieldrobotics.eu/) within the Signal and System Division, I am guided by Professor [George Nikolakopoulos](https://www.gnikolak.com/).

I hold an **Integrated Master's degree** in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/) from [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/), Greece, where I specialized in control and robotic systems.

My research focuses on edge computing architectures for robotic applications, aerial manipulation, and autonomy components.

My research focuses on **edge computing architectures for robotic applications**, **aerial manipulation**, and **autonomy components**. My work aims to advance robotic autonomy in challenging environments, while leveraging edge computing technologies.

🦾 I’m currently working on **Edge Robotics**

🖥️ I’m mainly working with **ROS 1 / ROS 2** | **Python** | **C++** | **Docker** | **Kubernetes**

💬 Feel free to ask me anything about robotics or edge computing [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/achilleas2942/achilleas2942/discussions)
